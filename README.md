# Weather-notifier-to-bring-umbrella
This code notify to bring umbrella if raining with a sms or email
his script fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on a specified latitude and longitude. If the script detects that it's going to rain within the next 24 hours, it sends an email notification. There's also commented-out code for sending an SMS notification using the Twilio API.

Here's a breakdown:

Imports:

import requests: Imports the requests library, which is used to make HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.
import smtplib: Imports the smtplib library, which is used for sending emails.
The commented-out imports are for sending SMS notifications using the Twilio API.
OpenWeatherMap API Configuration:

OWM_Endpoint: The base URL for the OpenWeatherMap API.
API_KEY: Your API key for accessing the OpenWeatherMap API.
weather_params: Parameters to be sent with the API request, including latitude, longitude, and the API key.
Fetching Weather Data:

Sends an HTTP GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API using requests.get(), passing the endpoint URL and parameters.
Checks the status code of the response and raises an exception if an error occurs.
Converts the JSON response to a Python dictionary.
Checking for Rain:

Iterates over the weather data for the next 24 hours (first 8 records).
Checks the weather condition code (condition_code) to determine if it indicates rain (codes below 700).
Sets will_rain to True if rain is predicted.
Sending Email Notification:

If will_rain is True, it sends an email notification using SMTP.
Requires specifying sender email, password, recipient email, and message content.
Commented-Out SMS Notification Code:

There's commented-out code for sending SMS notifications using the Twilio API.
It includes setting up Twilio credentials, creating a Twilio client, and sending an SMS message.
There's also a comment about configuring Twilio to run on PythonAnywhere.
The script demonstrates using APIs to fetch weather data and sending notifications based on that data, both via email and SMS. The commented-out Twilio code provides an alternative method for sending notifications via SMS.
